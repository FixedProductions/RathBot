:: Command Templates ::

> If the command has subcommands, you will need to add this method:
@Override
public boolean executeCommand(RathBot rb, IUser author, IChannel ch, String[] tokens, int tokDepth) {
  if (!super.executeCommand(rb, author, ch, tokens, tokDepth)) {
    [COMMAND BODY -- Executes if there are no sub-commands]
  }  
  return RBCommand.STOP_CMD_SEARCH;
}

> If the command does not have subcommands, you use this one:
@Override
public boolean executeCommand(final RathBot rb, final IUser author, final IChannel channel, final String[] tokens, final int tokenDepth) {
  [COMMAND BODY -- Executes unconditionally]
  return RBCommand.STOP_CMD_SEARCH;
}



:: Permission Levels ::

7 - Sudo: Rath & Kami 
6 - Admin: Administrators
5 - Moderator: Moderators
4 - Sub-mod: Moderators that are in a probationary period.
3 - Trusted: Users who have shown they can be mature and won't abuse the more advanced features of the bot.
2 - Standard: Normal users
1 - Minimal: Users who require a restricted command set because of command abuse.
0 - Forbid: Users who cannot use the bot.



:: Planned Commands (prefix: "rb!") ::

Required permission levels are in parentheses preceded by 'P': "(P4)" means the command requires level 4+.

> Fun
[ ] poll
  [ ] (P3) create <title> <time> <exc(lusive)/multi(-choice)> {options[;,]}: Creates a poll with the specified title
      for the specified length of time ("3m20s" would be 3 minutes and 20 seconds). Poll options are
      semicolon-separated and there must be at least two choices. Choices will be numbered for easy voting.
  [ ] (P1) vote <choices,>: Casts a vote for a choice or multiple comma-separated choices if enabled
  [ ] (P2) close: closes the currently open poll
[ ] (P2) sachis <user>: Posts how many Sachis $user has (server's currency, because Sachi is Best Grisaia Girl)
  [ ] (P4) add* <user> <amount>: Adds $amount Sachis to $user's account.
  [ ] (P2) give <user> <amount>: Transfers $amount Sachis to
  [ ] (P5) allowance* <user> <amount>: Changes the daily Sachi allowance for $member to $amount
[ ] (P2) react <name>: Posts the reaction image named $name. Due to the possibility of registering potentially large
    images, Rath will add these manually. They can be hot-swapped while the bot is running.

> Info
[X] (P1) help [command]: Posts the commands list if $command is not given; otherwise, posts the help text for $command.
[X] (P2) faq <name>: posts the contents of the $name FAQ
  [X] (P2) list: lists all stored FAQs
  [X] (P3) edit* <name> <content..>: Edits the contents of FAQ $name to $content, or creates it if it does not exist
  [X] (P4) remove* <name>: Removes a FAQ from memory.
[ ] (P1) uid**: Gets the internal ID for a user. This is needed for anonymous reports.
[ ] memstats
  [ ] (P2) memtime <user>: Post how long $user has been a member of this server.

> Administrative
[ ] (P1) report** <UID> <reason..>: Only accepted through a PM. Reports the member with UID = $uid for $reason. The
    report will get posted in #report and will be logged.
[ ] (P4) kick* <username> <reason..>: Kicks $username
[ ] (P5) ban* <username> <time+> <reason..>: Bans $username.
[ ] (P4) mute* <username> <time+> <reason..>: $username's new messages will be immediately deleted for $time. Posting
    too many messages during this time will result in a kick. A $reason may be given.
[ ] (P1) rule <X.Y.Z>: Posts rule X.Y.Z. Example: "rb! rule 14.1" will post "14.1: The Discord EULA overrides all rules
    set forth by this server."

> Bot-related
[ ] (P6) perm* <uid> <level>: Sets the user with UID=$uid to $level.
[ ] (P7) shutdown: Shuts the bot down as a last resort in case something goes haywire.
[ ] (P7) restart: Shuts the bot down and starts it back up.
[ ] (P7) rebuild: Deletes all saved data structures and rebuilds them.
[ ] (P3) running: Posts how long the bot has been running.


* Mod/Admin-only commands
** Must be done through a private message to RathBot

:: Other Things to Implement ::
> Track emoji use (for pruning unused ones)
