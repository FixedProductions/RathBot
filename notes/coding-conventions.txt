Follow these coding conventions for this repository. If you make a pull request and your code doesn't follow these,
  I will not accept the merge until you fix it.

1. Curly braces go on the same line
  Do this:
  public int getInt() {
    ...
  }
  
  Not this:
  public int getInt()
  {
    ...
  }
  
  
2. Do not use the tab character; use spaces in place of tabs.
3. Set your tab width to 2 spaces.
4. All classes, methods, fields, enums, interfaces, etc. must have Javadoc.
5. Code should be well-commented. Explaining the code's purpose is better than explaining what it's doing; we can
   read what it does. That being said, don't go overboard on the comments.
6. Constants should be in all caps with underscores separating words.
7. All methods and variables should be declared final unless they will be overriden or change.
8. Use descriptive identifiers for methods, classes, variables, etc.
